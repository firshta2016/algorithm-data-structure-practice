# algorithm-data-structure-practice

For the next couple of month I have dedicated myself to master algorithms and data structure as my
journey to becoming a software engineer. Each time I master an algorithm or data structure I will be pushing 
it here-(I wont push it unless I have mastered it in and out).

I will be working on:
  1. Binary Search
  2. Linear Search
  3. Insertion Sort
  4. Selection Sort
  5. Quick Sort
  6. Merge Sort
  7. AND DATA STRUCTURES ( I havent started those yet, I will update this as I go through them)
